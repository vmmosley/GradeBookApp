# GradeBookApp
A project completed in CSC251 to create a Text-Based Grade Book for a school. Allowed the ability to create courses, populate courses, add assignments, and display information for each student and course. 

For this project, we were given base files that we had to update with the class and function definitions that would make it work. The base was provided by the teacher. The test files, as well as all functions and class definitions, were written by me. The only exception was the StudentGenerator.java file, which was provided by the teacher.
